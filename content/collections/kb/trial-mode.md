Statamic will run in _Trial Mode_ (previously _Developer Mode_) if you're running on a non-public domain (like `.local` or `.test`). Our [article about how licensing works][licensing] explains how we define a public domain.

This allows you to try out Statamic and even develop the site until you're ready to purchase licenses.

Trial mode applies to the Statamic core as well as any commercial addons.

What we recommend is to run Statamic locally on a `mysite.test` domain. Then, when you're ready: purchase your licenses,
drop in the keys, and deploy your site.
